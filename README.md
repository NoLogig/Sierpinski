## Notes to Sierpinski & his contributions
*Wacław Franciszek Sierpiński (\*14 March 1882 – †21 October 1969)*
 was a Polish mathematician. He was known for contributions to **set theory** (research on the **axiom of choice** and the generalised **continuum hypothesis**), **number theory**, **theory of functions** and **topology**.

Well-known fractals are named after him (the **Sierpinski triangle**, the **Sierpinski carpet** and the **Sierpinski curve**), as are **Sierpinski numbers** and the associated **Sierpiński problem**.

### Sierpinski triangle

The **Sierpinski triangle**, also called the **Sierpinski gasket** or the **Sierpinski Sieve**, is a **fractal** and **attractive fixed set** with the overall *shape of an equilateral triangle, subdivided recursively into smaller equilateral triangles*. Originally constructed as a curve, this is one of the basic examples of *self-similar* sets, i.e., it is a mathematically generated pattern that is reproducible at any magnification or reduction.

## Environment 
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.0.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
